# StockLens

**A full-stack equities research workbench** — quotes and charts, deep company
financials, an interactive DCF valuation model, AI-written research reports,
a 7-agent "hedge fund" stock evaluator, side-by-side comparisons, a
multi-factor screener, SEC filing tools, congressional trading disclosures,
and macro indicators, all in one self-hosted app.

StockLens is built with **React, Express, TypeScript, and SQLite**. It
prefers real data over guesses: it caches aggressively to stay fast and
within free-tier API limits, and when a live source is unavailable it shows
an honest "no data" state instead of inventing one.

## Features

### Company Research Pages

Every ticker gets a dedicated page (`/company/:symbol`) organized into tabs:

* **Overview** — price, key stats, performance, and a candlestick/line chart
* **Info** — company profile, sector/industry, officers, description
* **Financials** — income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement history with computed ratios
* **SEC** — filing sections, insider trades, institutional holdings, and proxy data (see [SEC Filing Tools](#sec-filing-tools))
* **Analysis** — peer comparison and the DCF calculator

### DCF Intrinsic Value Calculator

A from-scratch, single-and-two-stage discounted cash flow model that runs
entirely on free data, with no paid valuation API:

* **CAPM-based WACC** — cost of equity from beta/risk-free rate/equity risk premium, cost of debt blended with a **Damodaran synthetic credit-rating table** (interest-coverage → rating → spread) instead of trusting a single noisy ratio
* **Two-stage growth decay** with FCF-margin interpolation across the projection window, plus **TTM blending** of trailing quarters so projections aren't stuck on stale fiscal-year-end numbers
* **SEC EDGAR cross-validation** — recomputes FCF/revenue from raw XBRL filings and diffs them against the Yahoo-derived figures, producing a `dataConfidence: high | medium | low` signal so you know how trustworthy each number is
* **Bear / Base / Bull scenario presets** plus full manual override of every assumption
* **Sensitivity grids** — WACC × terminal growth and revenue growth × FCF margin
* **Monte Carlo simulation** — 10,000-iteration sampling of beta, growth, margin, and WACC around their point estimates, rendered as a fair-value distribution with percentiles, instead of three fixed scenarios
* **Peer-relative sanity check** — flags when the DCF answer diverges sharply from peer-median P/E-implied value
* Provenance tooltips on every auto-populated input (source + as-of date), a 52-week price range overlay on the result, and one-click CSV export
* Guardrails for negative FCF, financial-sector applicability, WACC ≤ terminal growth, and missing shares-outstanding data

### AI Equity Research Reports

`GET /api/report/:ticker?format=pdf|word&type=snapshot|full` generates a
downloadable, analyst-style research report:

* Aggregates Yahoo fundamentals, SEC EDGAR filings, FRED macro context, and peer comps in one pass
* Runs the same multi-agent evaluation engine used by the Hedge Fund tool to inform commentary
* Computes valuation ratios and a **FinStar rating**
* Generates an **AI-written analyst note** (Gemini) summarizing the thesis
* Renders a price chart and exports the whole thing as a formatted **PDF or Word document**
* `type=snapshot` returns an executive-summary-only version (chart, valuation, peers, FinStar); `type=full` adds income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, business description, and risk factors

### Hedge Fund — Multi-Agent Stock Evaluator

`/hedge-fund` runs up to 10 tickers through **seven legendary-investor-style
agents**, each independently scoring the stock from its own philosophy:

| Agent | Style |
|---|---|
| Warren Buffett | Quality + moat at a fair price |
| Charlie Munger | Mental-models, business quality, simplicity |
| Benjamin Graham | Deep value, margin of safety |
| Bill Ackman | Concentrated activist/quality bets |
| Cathie Wood | Disruptive growth |
| Phil Fisher | Growth-at-scale, management quality |
| Stanley Druckenmiller | Macro-aware momentum |

Each agent returns a `bullish / bearish / neutral` signal, a confidence
score, and plain-English reasoning. A portfolio manager then combines all
seven views — plus an optional starting cash amount (default $100,000) —
into a final **BUY / SELL / HOLD** decision with a suggested allocation per
ticker.

### Stock Comparison

`/compare` lays multiple tickers side by side across profile, key stats
(market cap, EV, P/E, EPS, dividend), price performance (1W/3M/YTD/1Y),
income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, valuation ratios (P/E, forward
P/E, P/FCF, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA), and margins — useful for quickly sanity-checking
a name against its closest peers.

### Stock Screener

A multi-factor screener (`/screener`) over the local stock universe with
range filters on market cap, trailing/forward P/E, PEG, P/B, P/S, dividend
yield, ROE, ROA, debt-to-equity, current ratio, revenue growth, EPS growth,
and gross margin — plus sector and exchange selection (with multi-select and
aliasing, e.g. "Financials"/"Financial Services").

### Market Dashboard

`/market` — indices, top movers, breakouts, and sector performance at a glance.

### Watchlist

The home page (`/`) tracks a personal list of tickers with live quotes,
persisted to SQLite.

### SEC Filing Tools

Pulled directly from SEC EDGAR (no API key, just a compliant `User-Agent`):

* 10-K / 10-Q filing sections
* Form 4 insider trades
* 13F institutional holdings
* DEF 14A proxy statement data — pay-versus-performance and shareholding breakdowns rendered as dedicated panels on the company page

### Congressional Trading

Disclosed trades by members of Congress, sourced via Financial Modeling Prep.

### Macro Indicators

`/macro` surfaces FRED series covering rates and the broader economy: Fed
funds rate, 10Y/2Y Treasury yields and the 10Y-2Y spread, high-yield credit
spreads, CPI, core PCE inflation, unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, initial
jobless claims, real GDP, M2 money supply, retail sales, housing starts, and
consumer sentiment — plus an India 10-year yield series used as the
risk-free rate for the DCF calculator on Indian tickers.

### Search

Fast autocomplete across the local stock index, used throughout the app to
jump to a ticker.

## Why StockLens

Most retail investing dashboards either hide their data sources or quietly
invent values when a live API fails. StockLens does the opposite:

* it prefers **real data**,
* it **caches** results to reduce API pressure and stay within free-tier limits,
* it **cross-validates** where it can (Yahoo vs. SEC EDGAR for the DCF, peer comps vs. intrinsic value),
* and it shows **no-data / unavailable states** instead of fake placeholders.

### Design Philosophy

StockLens is strictly designed as a **single-process, single-user tool**.
Authentication, user management, and multi-tenancy are explicitly out of
scope. It's meant to be run locally or deployed for personal use — that
trade-off is what makes it practical to ship genuinely deep features (a real
DCF engine, a 7-agent evaluator, AI report generation) without the overhead
of a multi-tenant SaaS.

## Data Sources

| Source | Used for | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Yahoo Finance | Quotes, historical candles, profiles, financial statements, peers, news | None |
| SEC EDGAR | 10-K/10-Q sections, Form 4 insider trades, 13F holdings, DEF 14A proxy statements, DCF cross-validation | None, compliant `User-Agent` required |
| FRED | Macro indicators (rates, inflation, employment, GDP), DCF risk-free rate | API key |
| Financial Modeling Prep | Congressional trading disclosures | API key |
| Google Gemini | AI-written analyst notes in equity research reports | API key |

## Architecture

```text
React UI
   ↓
Express API
   ↓
Cache Layer (in-memory + optional Redis)
   ↓
SQLite Backup
   ↓
External Data Sources (Yahoo, SEC EDGAR, FRED, FMP, Gemini)
```

Outbound calls to Yahoo Finance run behind circuit breakers (`opossum`) with
request de-duplication, so a slow or rate-limited upstream degrades
gracefully instead of cascading failures across the app.

### Repository structure

```text
/server
  /routes      API routes: quotes, charts, screener, market, news, search,
               watchlist, edgar, macro, dcf, hedgefund, report, fundamentals
  /services    Data fetching (Yahoo, FRED, EDGAR), report generation
               (PDF/Word, AI notes, peer comps), the hedge-fund agent
               engine, caching, database helpers, cron jobs
  /middleware  Rate limiting and error handling

/src
  /pages       Main app pages (Watchlist, Screener, Market, Macro,
               Hedge Fund, Compare, CompanyPage/*)
  /components  Shared UI components
  /hooks       React Query data hooks
  /utils       Formatters and helpers
```

### Storage

SQLite is used for:

* stock universe seed data
* cached quotes and fundamentals
* SEC filing cache (for DCF cross-validation and the SEC tab)
* watchlist data
* cache logs

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 22+ recommended
* npm
* Optional API keys for FRED, Financial Modeling Prep, and Gemini (the app runs without them — see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables))

### Install

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Type checking

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## Environment Variables

```env
# Core
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info
SQLITE_DB_PATH=./stocklens.db

# Production-only
CLIENT_URL=                 # required in production for CORS allow-listing
CLUSTER=                    # set to "true" to enable Node cluster mode (multi-process)

# Optional external services
FRED_API_KEY=               # macro indicators + DCF risk-free rate
FMP_API_KEY=                # congressional trading disclosures
GEMINI_API_KEY=              # AI analyst notes in equity research reports
REDIS_URL=                   # optional Redis-backed cache instead of in-memory only
```

Notes:

* The app runs with **no API keys at all** — FRED-powered pages, congressional
  trading, and AI analyst notes will show unavailable states, but quotes,
  charts, financials, the screener, the DCF calculator, and the hedge-fund
  evaluator all work off Yahoo Finance and SEC EDGAR alone.
* `SQLITE_DB_PATH` is optional and defaults to a local database file.
* In production, `CLIENT_URL` must be set or CORS fails closed by design.
* `.env.example` only seeds `APP_URL` and `FRED_API_KEY` as a minimal
  starting point — copy the block above for the full set of variables the
  app actually reads.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Start the full-stack dev server (tsx, hot reload)
npm run build       # Build the client (Vite) and bundle the server (esbuild)
npm start            # Run the production server from dist/
npm run lint          # TypeScript type check (no emit)
npm test               # Run the vitest suite once
npm run test:watch      # Run vitest in watch mode
npm run clean             # Remove build artifacts
```

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Backend routes are tested with `vitest` + `supertest` against mocked
external services; valuation math (WACC, DCF, sensitivity grids, Monte
Carlo) is covered by pure-function unit tests in `src/utils/__tests__`.

---

## Reliability Notes

StockLens uses a simple data waterfall on every read:

1. **in-memory cache** (or Redis, if `REDIS_URL` is set) for speed
2. **SQLite backup** for persistence across restarts
3. **live fetch** for fresh data, behind a circuit breaker

If a live source is down or rate-limited, StockLens serves the last known
good value from cache/SQLite rather than failing the request outright, and
surfaces data freshness/confidence where it matters (e.g. the DCF
calculator's source provenance tooltips).
